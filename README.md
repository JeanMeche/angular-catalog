The App uses the Redux pattern with a store for state management. More on that on [ngrx.io](https://ngrx.io/guide/store).

Most of the state management files in this project are located in [`app/geo/store`](src/app/geo/store).

## Tailwind

Tailwind config is in [tailwind.config.js](tailwind.config.js).<br>
Extend the theme by adding colors for example. Using css variables will prevent duplicate definitions. See [styles.scss](src/styles.scss).

Tailwind will generate his set of classes from this config file. More on that [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration).

About the philosophy behind Tailwind, please read [CSS Utility Classes and "Separation of Concerns"](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/) by Tailwind creator, Adam Wathan.

## APi generation
